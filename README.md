accents
=======

Hi. I'm a starter theme called accents. I'm a fork of [\_s (underscores)](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) with all unnecessary cruft removed to provide the simplest starting point for WordPress theme development.

\_s, and thereby accents, are developed under the [GNU GPL v2.0](https://github.com/sevvie/accents/tree/master/LICENSE).
